Logging Audit Report - 2026-02-15

No non-zerolog logging imports or call sites were found in the project code (.go files).
Prohibited libraries (logrus, zap, slog, log) are present in go.mod only as indirect dependencies, primarily brought in by golangci-lint and other tools.

Verified with:
- grep -rE "logrus|zap|slog|\"log\"" --exclude-dir={.git,.beads,.norma,vendor,reports} .
- go mod why
